<p style="font-family:verdana;border:1px solid black;padding:4px white;margin:20px white;">Since time immemorial, sound has been an important thing to man. From the call of birds in the morning to the loud and powerful strum of the guitar at concerts, man has enjoyed pleasant sounds and has had a longing for them because of their ability to calm the soul and awaken the body in an exciting way. What happens when many pleasant sounds are combined together is called <b>music</b>. <b>Music</b> has existed for a long time now and more types of <b>music</b> have emerged over the years because of the different tastes of the many people we have in the world. There are different types of music like                                                                                                                                     <a href="http://www.google.com/what is hip-hop?">hip-hop</a>,                                                                                                         <a href="http://www.google.com/what is reggae?">reggae</a>,                                                                                                           <a href="http://www.google.com/what is ragga?">ragga</a>,                                                                                                               <a href="http://www.google.com/what is blues as a type of music?">blues</a>, e.t.c.
