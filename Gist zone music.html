<br><strong>4. Aye ole olori oko by Infinity</strong>
<p>Although this song was done in Yoruba(a Nigerian language), just listening to it even without knowing it's meaning would calm your soul. Infinity was a group of men who came together for the purpose of making good music. Just listen to the song and you will understand why I like it so much. Lest I forget, the song is basically talking about life.</p>
